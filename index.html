												<p>
												In soccer, modeling expected goals in a match is difficult without the use of player tracking data. Relying on just the tracking data of 
												the ball alone, we wanted to encapsulate the complex movement and forces acting on the ball into a much simpler object. This object 
												is the potential function, which is simply an equation used to model underlying forces (e.g. gravitational potential functions). 
												What we found is that predictions formed using this methodology capture high score differentials more reliably compared to a Poisson 
												Regression Model. Our work was presented at the 2021 Carnegie Mellon Sports Analytics Conference.

													As part of UCLA's DataRes Club I worked on creating an application to convert everyday images (such as nature scenes)
													into paintings. Using Pix2Pix and Cycle GAN architecture we were able to acheieve image style transformations to generate "Monet-esque" paintings
													from user input. We used the monet2photo dataset which contained thousands of examples of Monet paintings as well as photographs in order to train
													our Cycle GAN. To make our application user-friendly we hosted our work using Heroku and built our front-end with the Plotly-Dash framework.

													Using TensorFlow I created a web application with the goal of predicting a dog's breed using an image. Capable of predicting 121 dog breeds,
													this web app is built using Inception v3: a popular image recognition model finetuned by Google. On top of the breed clasifier, I also created a 
													page within the web app dedicated to recommending dog breeds to a user based on owner-preferences (i.e. amount of maintenance, dog size, ability to be trained).

													Among baseball enthusiasts there is a prevailing theory that the dimensions of a baseball stadium affect batting statistics. Nowhere is this more true than with The Green Monster - the left field wall at Fenway Park that is famous for preventing 
													home runs on many line drives that would clear the walls of other ballparks. In order to investigate trends like these, I use R Shiny to visualize how hit distance, effective speed, launch speed,
													and bases covered vary between all major baseball stadiums in the United States.

													<p> 
													For the 2021 UCSD DataHacks challenge, my group and I competed in the Economics track. This challenge focused on predicting prosperity and 
													growth of a given set of countries between the years 2007 and 2016 with regard to various factors like education, governance, etc. 
													Our group used the EvalML library (a subset of AutoML) to optimize our machine learning pipelines. We coupled our ML work
													with different interactive data visualizations to provide a growth report for countries of interest. <b>My team won 2nd place in our category.</b>

													In this article, I led a team of three other students to investigate vaccine rollout across the nation. By investigating vaccine success state-by-state, 
													we aimed to explain the disparity across the country. I used Facebook's Prophet library to look at different milestones concerning vacccination success, 
													including President Biden's 100-day plan. On top of the analysis of vaccine rollout, I also used NLP to interpret the twitter sentiment surrounding different 
													COVID-19 vaccines, international politicians, and other global entities.</b>

													As part of The Data Science Union at UCLA, my team and I worked on creating a salary predictor for NBA players. Using attributes like
													a player's position, age, turnover rate, and games played we sought to find out how much a player might make in their next season of play.
													After using linear/polynomial regression, support vector machines, and random forest, we landed on using the gradient boosted framework, XGBoost. 
													I developed a web application for my team, and built our final model by splitting data into Rookie/Veteran groups and running gradient 
													algorithms on different subgroups. </b>

													<p> Every year, thousands of hot dogs go to waste across Texas due to miscalculation of demand. We sought to help Chevron prevent this by extracting 
													insights into consumer behavior and creating a model that can accurately forecast sales. To do this, we utilized machine learning to create a 
													cook plan for certain buckets of time, saving Chevron money. We acheived a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 3.55 against new data (the lowest RMSE across 45 teams).

													Our final product was a heroku web application to gauge the best city for a user based on specified metrics and sklearn's davies_bouldin_score attribute.  
													After gauging the optimal cities for a user, we visualized these locations using geospatial mapping libraries. In order to capture what these locations look like we web-scraped multiple images for over 300 cities in order to display the beauty of a user's ideal city.

													We noticed a gap in catering for those with visual impairments and addressed this issue with the tremendous capabilities of speech recognition. 
													We essentially created a virtual assistant that can perform a variety of tasks. These tasks range from answering questions about the virus using an AI-powered chatbot, to enabling quick-and-easy

																<p>In an effort to better understand how powerful search engines such as Google function, I built the skeleton of the PageRank algorithm from scratch. 
													Having created this algorithm I used it to recognize important characters in the famous Broadway Play, Hamilton, as well as the most frequented

													character is mentioned by another character in Hamilton and how often a specific airport is visited in the context of departures/arrivals. </p>
